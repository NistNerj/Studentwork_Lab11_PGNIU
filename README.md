# Studentwork_Lab11_PGNIU
This is my lab assignment for the programming course; you shouldn't pay too much attention to it.

This work includes array sorting methods implemented in C++ using a custom library for storing the sorting algorithms.

List of sorting methods supported by the program:
1) Binary sort
2) Bubble sort
3) Quick sort
4) Quadratic selection sort
5) Centered Insertion Sort
6) Counting sort

Full CLI, no GUI.
